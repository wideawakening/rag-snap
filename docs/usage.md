# RAG Snap Usage Guide

> Prefer a browser to the terminal? `ragd` can serve a local web UI for chatting with your
> knowledge bases over an opt-in loopback listener. See the
> [Local web UI guide](local-ui.md) (`rag-cli.rag ui`).

## Knowledge base management

The `knowledge` command (alias `k`) manages the OpenSearch-backed knowledge bases used for
Retrieval-Augmented Generation. A **knowledge base** is an OpenSearch index that holds chunked,
vector-embedded documents. You can maintain multiple independent bases and search across them.

### Prerequisites

The OpenSearch snap must be running and reachable. Run `rag-cli.rag status` to verify connectivity before
using any `knowledge` sub-command.

---

### Sub-commands at a glance

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `knowledge init` | Create ingest/search pipelines and the shared index template |
| `knowledge models` | List the engine's registered models, their state and memory use |
| `knowledge models prune` | Undeploy and delete models the engine no longer uses |
| `knowledge models remove <id>` | Undeploy and delete one model |
| `knowledge list` | List knowledge bases (indexes) |
| `knowledge list --sources` | List ingested source documents |
| `knowledge create <name>` | Create a new knowledge base |
| `knowledge label <name> [<label>]` | Show or set a knowledge base's default label |
| `knowledge ingest <name> <source-id>` | Ingest a document into a knowledge base |
| `knowledge ingest <name> <source-id> --format rfp` | Ingest a CSV of previous RFP question/answer pairs, one chunk per row |
| `knowledge ingest --batch <config.yaml>` | Ingest multiple documents from a YAML config file |
| `knowledge search <query>` | Semantic + lexical search across one or more bases |
| `knowledge metadata <name> <source-id>` | Show metadata for an ingested source |
| `knowledge forget <name> <source-id>` | Remove a source and all its chunks |
| `knowledge delete <name>` | Delete an entire knowledge base |
| `knowledge export <name>` | Back up a knowledge base to a directory or `.tar.gz` archive |
| `knowledge import [name]` | Restore a knowledge base from a local export or a Google Drive folder/file |

---

### Typical workflow

```
1. knowledge init          # once per OpenSearch cluster
2. knowledge create <name> # once per topic / project
3. knowledge ingest …          # repeat for each document
4. knowledge ingest --batch <yaml>  # or ingest many at once from a YAML file
5. knowledge search …      # ad-hoc or used by chat
6. knowledge forget …      # when a source is outdated
7. knowledge delete …      # when a whole base is no longer needed
8. knowledge export …      # back up a base before migration or deletion
9. knowledge import …      # restore a base from a backup
```

---

### `knowledge init`

Registers the ML models and creates the ingest and search pipelines that every knowledge base
relies on. Run this **once** after the snap is installed or after OpenSearch is reset.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge init
```

The embedding and re-ranking models are fixed. Re-running is safe: an already-registered model is
reused (nothing is re-downloaded or deployed twice) and the pipelines are rewired to it — which is
how you recover after OpenSearch is reset. See `knowledge models` to check what is deployed.

**Example**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge init
```

It reports the model IDs it resolved as soon as it has them — so a failure in a later step still
tells you what was registered. When the `ragd` daemon is running it also writes them to the
package configuration for you:

```
Embedding model ID: d13rX58Bao98vwZu4-qa
  Saved to the package configuration (knowledge.model.embedding).
Rerank model ID: el3sX58Bao98vwZuduqL
  Saved to the package configuration (knowledge.model.rerank).
```

Without the daemon (or if the daemon could not write the configuration), it prints the command to
run instead: `sudo rag-cli.rag set --package knowledge.model.embedding="<id>"`.

---

### `knowledge models`

List the models registered in the engine's model group, with their deployment state, size, and the
role they serve.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge models
rag-cli.rag knowledge models prune [--yes]
rag-cli.rag knowledge models remove <model_id> [--force]
```

A **deployed** model is held in memory on every ML worker node whether or not the engine still
refers to it, and nothing removes one implicitly. Strays appear when an init is interrupted and
re-run inside the model index's refresh window, when two inits run at once, or when the model
version the engine targets changes — `init` reuses only an exact name-and-version match, so the
previous model is left deployed.

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--yes` (prune) | `-y` | `false` | Skip the confirmation prompt |
| `--force` (remove) | `-f` | `false` | Remove a model the engine currently uses |

`prune` removes every model no configuration key points at; the embedding and rerank models in use
are never touched. `remove` refuses an in-use model unless `--force` is given — after that, ingest
and search fail until `knowledge init` runs again.

**Example**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge models
```

```
MODEL ID                 NAME                                                 VERSION    STATE      SIZE       IN USE
d13rX58Bao98vwZu4-qa     huggingface/sentence-transformers/msmarco-distil…     1.0.2      DEPLOYED   253.6 MB   embedding
el3sX58Bao98vwZuduqL     huggingface/cross-encoders/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2    1.0.2      DEPLOYED   127.2 MB   rerank
csgcXJ8BFkzJBtapkxyO     huggingface/sentence-transformers/msmarco-distil…     1.0.2      DEPLOYED   253.6 MB   -

1 unused model(s) are deployed, holding about 253.6 MB per worker node.
Run 'knowledge models prune' to undeploy and delete them.
```

---

### `knowledge list`

List all knowledge bases, or list the source documents within a base.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge list [index_name] [--sources]
```

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--sources` | `-s` | `false` | List ingested sources instead of indexes |

**Example — list all knowledge bases**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge list

KNOWLEDGE BASE                 HEALTH     STATUS     DOCS         SIZE
docs                           green      open       142          4.3mb
wiki-rag                       green      open       318          9.1mb
```

**Example — list sources within a specific base**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge list docs --sources

SOURCE ID                                          KNOWLEDGE BASE                 STATUS       CHUNKS   INGESTED AT
snap-docs                                          docs                           completed    142      2025-06-01T10:00:00Z
```

**Example — list sources across all bases**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge list --sources

SOURCE ID                                          KNOWLEDGE BASE                 STATUS       CHUNKS   INGESTED AT
snap-docs                                          docs                           completed    142      2025-06-01T10:00:00Z
wiki-rag                                           wiki-rag                       completed    318      2025-06-02T14:22:10Z
```

---

### `knowledge create`

Create a new, empty knowledge base index.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge create <knowledge_base_name> [--label <label>]
```

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--label` | `-l` | _(convention)_ | Default knowledge label for sources ingested into this base |

The name must be a short identifier (letters, numbers, hyphens). It is used as a suffix for the
underlying OpenSearch index name.

Without `--label`, the base's default label follows the naming convention: `upstream` when the
name contains "upstream", otherwise `canonical`.

**Example**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge create docs
Knowledge base 'docs' created successfully.

$ rag-cli.rag knowledge create partner-docs --label partner
Knowledge base 'partner-docs' created successfully.
```

---

### `knowledge label`

Show or set a knowledge base's **default knowledge label**. Every ingested source carries exactly
one label; it is stamped onto the source's metadata and onto every chunk, and retrieved chunks are
tagged with it (uppercased, e.g. `[PARTNER]`) in search results and in the context sent to the LLM.

Labels have **no built-in meaning** — they are plain markers you define. To make the LLM prefer
one label over another, reference the tags in your system prompts (see the `prompt` command and
its named variants). The built-in default prompts already prioritise the default label set:
`[CANONICAL]` > `[KAPA-CANONICAL]` > `[UPSTREAM]`.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge label <knowledge_base_name> [<label>] [--apply-to-existing]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--apply-to-existing` | `false` | Also stamp the new label onto already-ingested chunks and sources **that have no label yet**. Sources ingested with an explicit `--label` are never overwritten. |

With no `<label>` argument the effective default is printed, together with whether it is stored or
derived from the naming convention. Setting a label affects future ingests only, unless
`--apply-to-existing` is given.

**Example**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge label docs
Default label: canonical (derived from the base name (not stored))

$ rag-cli.rag knowledge label docs internal --apply-to-existing
Default label of 'docs' set to 'internal'.
Labeled 142 existing chunk(s) that had no label.
```

Labels must be lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens, starting with a letter or digit, at most
32 characters.

---

### `knowledge ingest`

Ingest a document into a knowledge base. The document is parsed, converted to Markdown, split into
overlapping chunks, embedded, and stored in OpenSearch. Provide the document either as a local file
or a URL.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest <knowledge_base_name> <source_id> (--file <path> | --url <url>)
```

| Flag | Short | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--file` | `-f` | one of three | Local file path (PDF, HTML, plain text, …) |
| `--url` | `-u` | one of three | URL of a static HTML page to fetch and extract |
| `--batch` | `-B` | one of three | YAML batch config file — ingest multiple documents at once |
| `--format` | | No | Input format. Use `rfp` to ingest a CSV of question/answer/source rows (requires `--file`). Default auto-detects via Tika. |
| `--label` | `-l` | No | Knowledge label for this source. Defaults to the base's default label (see `knowledge label`). Not allowed with `--batch` — set per-job `label:` fields in the YAML instead. |
| `--force` | | No | Re-ingest the source even if it is already recorded as `completed`. The source's existing chunks are removed before re-indexing, so a forced re-ingest **replaces** the source rather than leaving duplicate chunks behind. |

`<source_id>` is a human-readable identifier you choose (e.g. `snap-docs`, `rag-wiki`). It is used
to reference the source in `metadata`, `forget`, and search results. It must be unique within the
cluster.

**Example — ingest a local PDF**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest docs snap-docs --file ~/Downloads/snapcraft-docs.pdf
Ingested 89 chunks into index 'rag-kb-docs'
```

**Example — ingest a web page**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest wiki-rag rag-wiki \
    --url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation
Ingested 37 chunks into index 'rag-kb-wiki-rag'
```

> **Note on JavaScript-heavy pages:** `--url` fetches and extracts static HTML. Pages that render
> their content entirely in JavaScript (SPAs) will produce an error with a suggestion to save the
> rendered page locally and use `--file` instead.

---

### `knowledge ingest --format rfp`

Ingest a CSV of previous RFP/RFI question-and-answer pairs. Each row becomes its own chunk that
keeps the question and answer together, so a search for a similar future question retrieves the
matching answer as a single unit — instead of the chunker splitting the question and answer apart
or mixing unrelated rows into one chunk.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest <knowledge_base_name> <source_id> --file <path.csv> --format rfp
```

#### CSV layout

The first row is treated as a header and skipped. Columns are read positionally:

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| A | Question |
| B | Answer |
| C | Source / reference (optional — e.g. the original document the answer came from) |

Extra columns are ignored. Rows where both the question and answer are empty are skipped.

#### Chunking behaviour

Each row is rendered as a single chunk:

```
Question: <question text>

Answer: <answer text>

Reference: <source>
```

(the `Reference:` line is omitted if column C is empty). If the rendered chunk exceeds the default
chunk size, the answer is split into multiple chunks, with the `Question:` and `Reference:` lines
repeated on every segment so each chunk remains self-contained and embeddings stay anchored to the
original question. No overlap is applied between chunks — `knowledge metadata` reports
`overlap=0` for sources ingested this way.

**Example**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest sales master-rfp --file MasterRFP.csv --format rfp
Ingested 1889/1889 chunks into index 'rag-kb-sales'
```

`--format rfp` requires `--file` (CSV input); it cannot be combined with `--url` or `--batch`.

---

### `knowledge ingest --batch`

Ingest multiple documents in a single command using a YAML configuration file. Each job is
processed sequentially; a failure on one job is reported and skipped — the remaining jobs
continue.

Supported job types: local files, static web pages, GitHub repositories, and Gitea (Opendev)
repositories. Repository jobs walk the entire tree and ingest every file that matches the
configured extensions and optional path filter.

> **Tip:** the [local web UI](local-ui.md) can build this manifest visually (with a per-repository
> file preview), run it directly, or download it for use with this command.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest --batch <config.yaml> [--force]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--force` | `false` | Re-ingest sources that are already present in the knowledge base. By default, any source whose `source_id` is already recorded with status `completed` is skipped silently. Pass `--force` to override this and re-ingest regardless — the existing chunks are removed first, so the source is replaced rather than duplicated. |

> **Default deduplication behaviour:** Each source is identified by its `source_id` (the file path,
> URL, or repo-qualified path for repository jobs). On every run the system checks whether that ID is
> already marked as `completed` in the metadata index. If it is, the source is skipped and a message
> is printed. This makes repeated runs of the same batch file safe — only new or previously-failed
> sources are ingested. Use `--force` when you want to refresh content that has changed since the
> last ingest.

> **Source IDs are global.** The metadata index is keyed by `source_id` alone, not by
> `(source_id, target_kb)`, so an ID collision across knowledge bases causes the second source to be
> skipped — or, under `--force`, to overwrite the first one's metadata record. Repository jobs
> therefore qualify each file with its repository (`owner/repo/<path>` for `github-repo`,
> `host/owner/repo/<path>` for `gitea-repo`) so that, for example, `README.md` in two different repos
> does not collapse onto one ID. When setting `name` explicitly, choose an ID unique across the whole
> cluster.

> **Upgrading: repository source IDs changed.** Earlier versions keyed each repository file by its
> bare in-repo path (`README.md`), which collided across repositories. They are now keyed
> `owner/repo/<path>` as described above. Nothing already in a knowledge base is rewritten, so a
> repository ingested before the upgrade keeps its old IDs, and re-ingesting it adds a second copy of
> every file under the new ID rather than replacing the first — `--force` does not help, because it
> matches on the ID that changed. To move a repository onto the new scheme, remove the old entries
> first (`rag-cli.rag k forget <base> <old-path-id>` per file, or `rag-cli.rag k delete <base>` and
> re-create it if the base holds nothing else), then ingest again. A base you never re-ingest is
> unaffected and keeps working.

#### YAML schema

```yaml
version: "1.0"
jobs:
  - type: file | url | github-repo | gitea-repo
    source: <path, URL, or repo identifier>
    name: <source_id>         # optional; defaults to filename or path within the repo
    target_kb: <name>         # optional; defaults to "default"
    branch: <branch-name>     # github-repo / gitea-repo only — defaults to the repo's default branch
    path: <subdir>            # github-repo / gitea-repo only — restrict to a subdirectory
    extensions:               # github-repo / gitea-repo only — file extensions to include
      - .md
      - .txt
    label: <label>            # optional; knowledge label for the job's sources
```

| Field | Applies to | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | all | Yes | Job type: `file`, `url`, `github-repo`, or `gitea-repo` |
| `source` | all | Yes | For `file`: absolute or relative path. For `url`: `https://` URL. For `github-repo`: `"owner/repo"` or `"https://github.com/owner/repo"`. For `gitea-repo`: full URL `"https://{host}/{owner}/{repo}"`. |
| `name` | all | No | Source identifier used in `metadata`, `forget`, and search results. Defaults to the filename (for `file`/`url`) or the repo-qualified path — `owner/repo/<path>`, `host/owner/repo/<path>` for Gitea — for repository jobs. Must be unique across the cluster. |
| `target_kb` | all | No | Knowledge base name. Defaults to `default`. The base must already exist (`knowledge create`). |
| `branch` | repo types | No | Branch to read from. Defaults to the repository's default branch. |
| `path` | repo types | No | Restrict ingestion to files under this subdirectory (e.g. `docs/`). Omit to process the entire repository. |
| `extensions` | repo types | Yes* | List of file extensions to ingest (e.g. `.md`, `.rst`, `.txt`). At least one extension is required — files that do not match are skipped. |
| `label` | all | No | Knowledge label stamped onto the job's sources and chunks. Defaults to the target base's default label (see `knowledge label`). |

**Example config — all four job types**

```yaml
version: "1.0"
jobs:
  # Local file
  - type: file
    source: "/home/user/docs/api-reference.pdf"
    name: "api-reference"
    target_kb: "project-docs"

  # Static web page
  - type: url
    source: "https://example.com/blog/release-notes"
    name: "release-notes"
    target_kb: "project-docs"

  # GitHub repository — ingest only Markdown files under the docs/ subdirectory
  # from a specific branch; requires GITHUB_TOKEN for private repos
  - type: github-repo
    source: "https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft"
    branch: "main"
    path: "docs/"
    extensions:
      - .md
    target_kb: "project-docs"

  # Gitea / Opendev repository — ingest reStructuredText and Markdown files
  # from the entire default branch; requires GITEA_TOKEN for private instances
  - type: gitea-repo
    source: "https://opendev.org/openstack/nova"
    path: "doc/source/"
    extensions:
      - .rst
      - .md
    target_kb: "openstack-docs"
```

**Example — run a batch**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest --batch ~/docs/batch.yaml

---

### `knowledge search`

Run a hybrid semantic + lexical search across one or more knowledge bases.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge search <query> [--bases <name,...>] [--top <k>]
```

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bases` | `-b` | `default` | Comma-separated list of knowledge base names to search |
| `--top` | `-k` | `10` | Maximum number of results returned per index |

**Example — search the default base**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge search "how does vector search work"

--- Result 1 (score: 0.9821, index: rag-kb-default) [CANONICAL] ---
  Source: rag-wiki
  Date:   2025-06-02T14:22:10Z
  Vector search (also called semantic search) finds documents by comparing high-dimensional …

Total: 10 results
```

**Example — search across multiple bases**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge search "snap confinement" --bases docs,wiki-rag --top 5
```

---

### `knowledge metadata`

Show the stored metadata record for a specific ingested source.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge metadata <knowledge_base_name> <source_id>
```

**Example**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge metadata docs snap-docs

Source ID:      snap-docs
Knowledge base: docs
Status:         completed
File name:      snapcraft-docs.pdf
File path:      /home/user/Downloads/snapcraft-docs.pdf
Content type:   application/pdf
Content length: 1048576 bytes
Checksum:       a3f1c2…
Chunks:         89 (size=512, overlap=64)
Ingested at:    2025-06-01T10:00:00Z
Updated at:     2025-06-01T10:00:42Z
Title:          Snapcraft Documentation
Author:         Canonical
Language:       en
```

---

### `knowledge forget`

Remove a single source document and all its chunks from a knowledge base. The source metadata
record is also deleted. Use this to replace outdated content: forget the old source, then ingest
the updated file under the same `source_id`.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge forget <knowledge_base_name> <source_id>
```

**Example**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge forget docs snap-docs
Deleted 89 chunks and metadata for source 'snap-docs' from index 'rag-kb-docs'
```

**Refresh a source with updated content**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge forget docs snap-docs
rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest docs snap-docs --file ~/Downloads/snapcraft-docs-v2.pdf
```

---

### `knowledge export`

Back up a knowledge base — all document chunks (with their pre-computed embeddings), the index
mapping, and source metadata — to a local directory or a compressed `.tar.gz` archive.
The export uses [elasticdump](https://github.com/ElasticTools/elasticdump) bundled in the snap and
preserves the embeddings so that an import requires no re-embedding.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge export <knowledge_base_name> [--output <path>] [--compress]
```

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--output` | `-o` | `./<name>-export` | Output directory (or archive base name when used with `--compress`) |
| `--compress` | `-c` | `false` | Produce a `.tar.gz` archive and remove the intermediate directory |

The output directory (or archive) contains four files:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data.json` | All document chunks with embeddings (NDJSON, elasticdump format) |
| `mapping.json` | Index mapping (NDJSON, elasticdump format) |
| `sources.json` | Source metadata records (NDJSON, elasticdump format) |
| `manifest.json` | Export summary: knowledge base name, index name, timestamp, source count, chunk count |

A missing `manifest.json` indicates an incomplete export. `knowledge import` will reject it.

**Example — export to a directory**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge export project-docs
Exporting document data to ./project-docs-export/data.json...
Exporting mapping to ./project-docs-export/mapping.json...
Exporting source metadata to ./project-docs-export/sources.json...

Export complete.
  Sources:  3
  Chunks:   228
  Location: ./project-docs-export
```

**Example — export to a compressed archive**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge export project-docs --compress
Exporting document data to ./project-docs-export/data.json...
Exporting mapping to ./project-docs-export/mapping.json...
Exporting source metadata to ./project-docs-export/sources.json...
Compressing to ./project-docs-export.tar.gz...

Export complete.
  Sources:  3
  Chunks:   228
  Location: ./project-docs-export.tar.gz
```

**Example — custom output path**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge export project-docs --output /mnt/backups/project-docs --compress
# → /mnt/backups/project-docs.tar.gz
```

---

### `knowledge import`

Restore a knowledge base from an export produced by `knowledge export`. Pre-computed embeddings
are imported as-is — no re-embedding step is needed and no ML models need to be running during
import.

Two source types are supported:

- **Local** (`--input`) — a directory or `.tar.gz` archive on the local filesystem.
- **Google Drive** (`--url`) — a shared Drive folder containing one or more `.tar.gz` archives,
  or a direct link to a single `.tar.gz` file.

If a knowledge base name is omitted, the name stored in the export manifest is used automatically.
Provide a name to restore under a different name (e.g. to clone or migrate a base).

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge import [knowledge_base_name] (--input <path> | --url <gdrive-url>) [flags]
```

| Flag | Short | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--input` | `-i` | one of two | Path to the export directory or `.tar.gz` archive |
| `--url` | `-u` | one of two | Google Drive folder or file URL to import from |
| `--all` | | No | Import all archives from a Drive folder without interactive selection |
| `--force` | | No | Overwrite even if the target index already contains documents |

`--input` and `--url` are mutually exclusive.

The local input format is detected automatically:

- **Directory** — used directly as the export root.
- **`.tar.gz` file** — extracted into a temporary directory, imported, then cleaned up.

---

#### Local import

**Example — restore using the original name (from manifest)**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge import --input ./project-docs-export.tar.gz
Extracting ./project-docs-export.tar.gz...
Using knowledge base name from manifest: "project-docs"
Importing mapping...
Importing document data...
Importing source metadata...

Import complete.
  Sources imported: 3
  Chunks imported:  228
```

**Example — restore under a different name**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge import project-docs-staging --input ./project-docs-export.tar.gz
```

**Example — overwrite an existing index**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge import project-docs --input ./project-docs-export --force
```

---

#### Google Drive import

Archives are fetched directly from a shared Google Drive folder or file. On the first run you are
prompted to authenticate with your Google account through a browser. The token is cached
automatically and silently refreshed on subsequent runs — you will only need to authenticate once.

Supported Drive URL formats:

| URL form | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID` | List all `.tar.gz` files in the folder |
| `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/FOLDER_ID` | Same, user-scoped variant |
| `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view` | Download that single file directly |
| `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID` | Download that single file directly |
| `https://drive.google.com/open?id=FILE_ID` | Download that single file directly |

**Example — import from a Drive folder (interactive selection)**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge import --url "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID"

Listing archives in Google Drive folder...

  Select archives to import
  > [x] project-docs-export.tar.gz (12.4 MB)
    [ ] scratch-export.tar.gz (1.1 MB)
    [x] wiki-rag-export.tar.gz (9.3 MB)

[1/2] Downloading project-docs-export.tar.gz...
  Importing as knowledge base "project-docs"...
  Importing mapping...
  Importing document data...
  Importing source metadata...

  Import complete.
    Sources imported: 3
    Chunks imported:  228

[2/2] Downloading wiki-rag-export.tar.gz...
  Importing as knowledge base "wiki-rag"...
  ...
```

Use Space to toggle archives, Enter to confirm, Esc/Ctrl-C to cancel the selection.

**Example — import all archives from a folder without prompting**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge import --url "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID" --all
```

**Example — import a single file from Drive**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge import --url "https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view"
```

**Example — restore a Drive archive under a different name**

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge import project-docs-staging \
    --url "https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view"
```

> **Browser UI:** the local UI's **Import** dialog can also import from Google Drive (choose
> **From Google Drive**), reaching parity with `import --url`. There, the daemon mediates the OAuth
> consent (it opens Google's consent screen in a new tab and stores the token on the machine), so the
> UI's Drive connection is **independent of the CLI's** cached token — connecting in one does not
> connect the other. The daemon path requires `gdrive.client.id` and `gdrive.client.secret` to be set
> in package config.

> **Note on authentication:** `knowledge import --url` requires a Google account that has at least
> viewer access to the Drive resource. The OAuth token is cached at
> `~/.config/rag-cli/gdrive-token.json` (or `$SNAP_USER_DATA/gdrive-token.json` when running as a
> snap). Delete this file to force re-authentication.

> **Note on KB naming:** When importing from a folder, the knowledge base name is derived from the
> archive filename by stripping `.tar.gz` and a trailing `-export` suffix
> (e.g. `project-docs-export.tar.gz` → `project-docs`). Pass `[knowledge_base_name]` to override
> this for all archives in the batch, or use `--input` with a single archive for precise control.

> **Note on infrastructure:** `knowledge import` automatically ensures the index template and
> sources metadata index exist before importing. You do not need to run `knowledge init` first,
> but the ML models and pipelines set up by `init` are required if you later ingest new documents
> into the restored base.

---

### `knowledge delete`

Delete an entire knowledge base index and all associated source metadata. This operation is
**irreversible**. You will be prompted to type the knowledge base name to confirm.

```
rag-cli.rag knowledge delete <knowledge_base_name>
```

**Example**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag knowledge delete docs

The following 2 source(s) will be permanently deleted:

  SOURCE ID                                          STATUS       CHUNKS   INGESTED AT
  snap-docs                                          completed    89       2025-06-01T10:00:00Z
  contributing-guide                                 completed    12       2025-06-03T09:15:00Z

This will permanently delete the index 'rag-kb-docs' and all its data.
Type the knowledge base name to confirm: docs
Deleted index 'rag-kb-docs' and 2 source metadata record(s).
```

---

# 9. Clean up when the project is archived
rag-cli.rag knowledge delete project-docs
```

## Chat

The `chat` command (alias `c`) opens an interactive REPL that sends your prompts to the inference
server and, when a knowledge base is available, automatically retrieves relevant context before
each answer (RAG).

### Sub-commands at a glance

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `chat [model]` | Open an interactive RAG chat session |

---

### Starting a session

```
rag-cli.rag chat [model_name] [--temperature <float>] [--prompt <variant>]
```

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model_name` | No | LLM model identifier. Auto-detected from the inference server when omitted. |

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--temperature` | `0.3` | Sampling temperature (0.0–1.0). Lower values produce more deterministic responses; higher values allow more creative variation. |
| `--prompt` | (active) | Name of a `chat_system_prompt` variant to use for this session only (see [Prompt](#prompt)). Requires the `ragd` daemon. |

**Example — auto-detect model**

```bash
rag-cli.rag chat
```

**Example — choose a specific model**

```bash
rag-cli.rag chat deepseek-r1:8b
```

If the inference server requires authentication, set the `CHAT_API_KEY` environment variable before
starting:

```bash
CHAT_API_KEY=sk-… rag-cli.rag chat
```

The client waits up to 60 seconds for the model to finish loading before giving up.

---

### The REPL

```
Using inference server at http://localhost:8324
Using the `default` knowledge base at http://localhost:9200
  > Use `/use-knowledge` to see other available knowledge bases

Type your prompt, then ENTER to submit. CTRL-C to quit.
»
```

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| Type a prompt, press Enter | Send to the LLM (with RAG context if available) |
| `Tab` | Autocomplete slash commands |
| Finish typing a slash command name | A dimmed inline hint shows its argument syntax (e.g. `/search [-k N] <query>`) |
| `Ctrl-C` (empty line) | Exit the session |
| `Ctrl-C` (mid-prompt) | Cancel current input, stay in session |
| Type `exit`, press Enter | Exit the session |

Input history is available within the session via the Up/Down arrow keys.

---

### Slash commands

Slash commands are processed locally and never sent to the LLM. Start typing `/` and use Tab to
autocomplete.

#### `/use-knowledge`

Opens an interactive multi-select menu to choose which knowledge bases are active for the rest of
the session. Changes take effect on the very next prompt.

```
» /use-knowledge

  Select active knowledge bases
  > [x] docs (142 docs, 4.3mb)
    [x] wiki-rag (318 docs, 9.1mb)
    [ ] scratch (5 docs, 0.1mb)
```

Use Space to toggle, Enter to confirm, Esc/Ctrl-C to keep the current selection unchanged.

#### `/search`

Retrieves matching chunks from the active knowledge bases and prints them, without generating an
answer — retrieval only, no augmentation. It runs the same hybrid pipeline (BM25 + neural + rerank)
that chat uses, over exactly the knowledge bases toggled with `/use-knowledge`, passing your terms
verbatim (no query rewriting, no inference-server call). Useful for inspecting what RAG would feed
the model for a given query.

```
» /search [-k N] <query>
```

- `<query>` — the keywords or question to retrieve for.
- `-k N` — maximum number of results (default: 15). Also accepts `-k=N`.

Each result shows its relevance score, knowledge base name, knowledge-label tag (e.g.
`[CANONICAL]`, `[UPSTREAM]`, or any label you assigned at ingest — see `knowledge label`), source
ID, creation date, and the full (untruncated) chunk content. Results are ordered by score
descending.

```
» /search -k 5 ceph osd recovery

[1] score 0.8421  ·  ops-docs  [CANONICAL]
    source: ceph/recovery.md   created: 2026-03-11
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    <full chunk content>
```

If no knowledge bases are active, `/search` tells you to select some with `/use-knowledge` first; an
empty query or an invalid `-k` prints a short usage line.

#### `/save`

Saves the current conversation locally so you can return to it later, the way Claude Code keeps
per-session transcripts. A second `/save` in the same session (including after resuming one)
updates the same saved chat in place rather than creating a duplicate.

```
» /save [title]
```

- `[title]` — an optional title. When omitted, the title is derived from your first prompt.

Saving before you have asked anything is rejected with a short note — there is nothing to save yet.

#### `/history`

Lists your saved chats newest-first in a filterable menu; type to narrow by title or content, then
pick one to resume. Resuming restores the conversation history (so follow-up questions can refer to
earlier turns) and the knowledge bases that were active when it was saved. A saved base that no
longer exists is skipped with a note. Esc/Ctrl-C leaves the current session unchanged.

```
» /history

  Resume a saved chat
  > Rotating the OpenSearch admin password  ·  2h ago  ·  4 turns
    Bedrock inference setup                 ·  1d ago  ·  6 turns
```

**Where saved chats live.** When you chat through a running `ragd` daemon — the browser UI and the
CLI when the daemon is up — saved chats are stored by the daemon under `$SNAP_COMMON/ragd/chats/`,
so the UI and the CLI share one history. When you chat without a daemon (direct mode), they are
stored client-locally under your config directory (`~/.config/rag-cli/chats/`); that store is
separate from the daemon's. Either way the transcripts never leave the machine.

---

### How RAG works in chat

Each time you send a prompt, the following happens automatically:

```
1. Query rewriting
   The last 3 turns of conversation are summarised into search keywords so
   that follow-up questions ("what about the storage layer?") retrieve the
   right chunks even without repeating context.

2. Hybrid search
   The rewritten keywords are used for a BM25 (lexical) search; the original
   prompt is used for a semantic (vector) search. Results are merged and
   ranked by relevance.

3. Context injection
   The top-10 chunks are prepended to your prompt before it is sent to the
   LLM. The model is instructed to cite sources and to explicitly say when
   the context is insufficient rather than fabricate an answer.

4. History
   Only your original prompt (not the augmented one) is saved in the
   conversation history, keeping the history clean for subsequent rewrites.
```

When no knowledge base is reachable, the client falls back to plain chat with no retrieval step.

#### Reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, QwQ, …)

Models that emit `<think>…</think>` reasoning blocks before their answer are fully supported.
Reasoning text is rendered in blue so you can distinguish thinking from the final response.
Think blocks are automatically stripped when building the search query rewrite context so they
do not pollute subsequent retrieval queries.

---

### Best practices

**Match knowledge bases to topics.** Searching across many unrelated bases dilutes relevance
scores. Create one base per project or domain and use `/use-knowledge` to activate only the
relevant ones before each conversation.

```bash
# ingest project docs into a dedicated base
rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest project-x api-ref --file ~/docs/api.pdf

# start chat, then switch to it
rag-cli.rag chat
» /use-knowledge   # select project-x
» How does the authentication flow work?
```

**Ask specific questions first.** The hybrid search works best with concrete nouns and technical
terms. Opening with "explain the whole system" pulls broad, low-scoring chunks. Narrow questions
("what ports does the snap use by default?") retrieve sharper context.

**Use follow-up questions freely.** The query rewriter carries conversation context forward, so
short follow-ups like "what about the fallback path?" correctly resolve to the topic already
established in the session. You do not need to repeat yourself.

**Trust the model's "I don't know".** The RAG prompt explicitly instructs the model to state when
the retrieved context is insufficient rather than guess. If you get that response, the relevant
content is likely not ingested yet — add it with `knowledge ingest` and try again.

**Refresh stale sources before long sessions.** Outdated chunks can lower answer quality. Before
a working session on a topic, check ingestion dates and refresh changed documents:

```bash
rag-cli.rag knowledge list my-base --sources   # check dates
rag-cli.rag knowledge forget my-base old-doc
rag-cli.rag knowledge ingest my-base old-doc --file ~/docs/updated.pdf
```

**Debug with `--verbose`.** Pass `-v` before the subcommand to see which model is chosen, how many
RAG chunks were retrieved, and the rewritten search keywords:

```bash
rag-cli.rag -v chat
```

Sample verbose output during a turn:

```
Extracting lexical keywords
Search keywords: snap confinement interfaces plugs slots
Retrieved 8 results from knowledge base
```

### Example session

```
$ rag-cli.rag chat

Using inference server at http://localhost:8324
Using the `default` knowledge base at http://localhost:9200
  > Use `/use-knowledge` to see other available knowledge bases

Type your prompt, then ENTER to submit. CTRL-C to quit.

  [x] snap-docs  (89 docs, 2.1mb)

» What interfaces are required for network access in a strict snap?

  Based on the snapcraft documentation, a strictly confined snap needs the
  `network` plug to make outbound connections and `network-bind` to open
  listening sockets. Declare them under `plugs:` in snapcraft.yaml:

    plugs:
      network:
      network-bind:

  (source: snap-docs, score: 0.9743)

» And for hardware serial ports?

  For serial port access the snap needs the `serial-port` interface, which
  requires manual connection by the user:

    sudo snap connect mysnap:serial-port

  (source: snap-docs, score: 0.9512)

Closing chat
```

## Answer

The `answer` command (alias `a`) runs questions through the RAG+LLM pipeline non-interactively
and exports the results to a JSON file. Use it for batch Q&A workflows such as RFP responses,
compliance questionnaires, and documentation audits.

### Sub-commands at a glance

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `answer batch <manifest.yaml>` | Run questions from a YAML file and export answers to JSON |
| `answer batch --build <document>` | Extract RFP/RFI questions from a document and generate a batch manifest |

---

### `answer batch`

Run a list of questions from a YAML manifest through the RAG+LLM pipeline non-interactively.
Each question is answered in sequence, printed to the terminal, and the full set of results is
written to a timestamped JSON file in the current working directory.

```
rag-cli.rag answer batch <manifest.yaml> [--temperature <float>]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--temperature` | `0.1` | Sampling temperature (0.0–1.0). The low default keeps answers grounded and consistent across runs. Raise it for more varied phrasing. |

#### YAML schema

```yaml
version: "1.0"
model: <model_id>             # optional; inherits from config or auto-detected from server
knowledge_bases:              # optional; defaults to the default knowledge base
  - <name>
prompt: <system_prompt>       # optional; overrides the default RAG system prompt for the whole batch
prompt_ref: <variant_name>    # optional; use a stored answer_system_prompt variant (daemon only; not with 'prompt')
domains:                      # optional; answer groups of questions within a stated requirement domain
  - match: <glob>             # question id (or source) pattern this entry applies to
    context: <text>           # optional if keywords are given; one sentence naming the domain
    keywords: [<term>, ...]   # optional if context is given; extra retrieval terms
questions:
  - id: <identifier>          # optional; included in the output file for traceability
    question: <text>
    keywords: [<term>, ...]   # optional; extra retrieval terms for this question
    source: <text>            # optional; origin label, also a domain routing fallback
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | Yes | Schema version. Use `"1.0"`. |
| `model` | No | LLM model identifier. Falls back to the `chat.model` config value, then to server auto-detection. |
| `knowledge_bases` | No | List of knowledge base names to search for context. Defaults to the `default` base. |
| `prompt` | No | Custom system prompt for the entire batch. Overrides the built-in RAG answer prompt. `source_rules` is appended to it. Mutually exclusive with `prompt_ref`. |
| `prompt_ref` | No | Name of a stored `answer_system_prompt` variant to run the batch on (see [Prompt](#prompt)). Requires the `ragd` daemon; mutually exclusive with `prompt`. The resolved `variant@version` is recorded in the output JSON. |
| `domains` | No | Routing table mapping question ids to requirement domains. Omit it and every question is answered the same way — see [Domain routing](#domain-routing). |
| `domains[].match` | Yes | Glob matched against the question id (`*` and `?` supported), case-insensitive. Two entries may not declare the same pattern. |
| `domains[].context` | No\* | One sentence naming the requirement domain. Appended to that question's prompt as `Requirement domain: <context> Answer within this domain.` |
| `domains[].keywords` | No\* | Retrieval terms added to the lexical query for questions this entry matches, after the question's own `keywords`. |
| `questions[].id` | No | Identifier for the question, used in the output JSON for traceability and as the key `domains` routes on. |
| `questions[].question` | Yes | The question text sent to the LLM. |
| `questions[].keywords` | No | Retrieval terms for this question. They lead the lexical query, ahead of any domain keywords and the generated ones, so they have the highest BM25 priority. |
| `questions[].source` | No | Where the question came from — a spreadsheet sheet name or document section, populated by `answer batch --build`. Also the key `domains` falls back to when the id is a bare sequence number. |

\* An entry needs a `context`, `keywords`, or both. An entry with neither is rejected, not ignored,
so an uncommented but unfilled block fails before the first question is answered rather than
running as if no routing were configured.

#### Domain routing

By default every question in a batch is answered the same way. An optional `domains:` block scopes
groups of questions to a stated requirement domain: the matched entry's `context` is added to that
question's prompt, and its `keywords` are added to that question's retrieval query. Which entry
applied is recorded on each answer in the output JSON, so the routing is auditable after the fact.

Resolution is deterministic and happens in the CLI, not by instructing the model:

- **Matching key.** The question's `id` is matched first, case-insensitively. Patterns may use `*`
  (any run of characters) and `?` (one character).
- **Most specific wins.** Where several patterns match, the one with the most literal
  (non-wildcard) characters wins — `J1.*` beats `J*` for `J1.4`. Ties go to the entry listed
  first, so the table needs no particular ordering.
- **Catch-all.** A `match: "*"` entry matches every question, and being the least specific it only
  applies where nothing else does.
- **Source fallback.** When an id is a bare sequence number (`"17"`) it carries no domain prefix to
  route on, so the question's `source` is matched instead — but only if the id itself matched
  nothing. An id that matched is never re-matched against its source, and a `*` catch-all counts as
  matching the id, so it pre-empts the fallback.
- **No match.** A question no entry reaches is answered exactly as it would be with no `domains:`
  block at all, and its `domain` is absent from the output.
- **A question with no `id`** can only be reached by a catch-all: the id is matched verbatim, with
  no substitution of the question's position in the file.

Keep `keywords` on a domain few and domain-defining. They are merged after the question's own
keywords, but a broad domain contributing many terms can pull BM25 toward the domain's vocabulary
and away from what the individual question actually asks. An entry that only needs to scope the
answer should carry `context` alone.

**Example — a routed manifest**

```yaml
version: "1.0"
knowledge_bases:
  - vendor-docs
domains:
  - match: "C*"
    context: "Compute platform capabilities, including CPU features and NUMA topology."
    keywords: [sriov, numa]
  - match: "J*"
    context: "Hardware supply and warranty terms."
  - match: "J1.*"
    context: "Storage hardware supplied by the incumbent vendor."
  - match: "GIS Deliverables"
    context: "Geographic information system deliverables and their acceptance criteria."
questions:
  - id: "C4"
    question: "Do you support SR-IOV passthrough?"       # → C*
  - id: "J1.4"
    question: "What is the warranty on the disk shelves?" # → J1.* (more literals than J*)
  - id: "J2.1"
    question: "What is the lead time on spares?"          # → J*
  - id: "17"
    question: "List the map layers delivered at each milestone."
    source: "GIS Deliverables"                            # → matched on source, id is a bare number
  - id: "A9"
    question: "Who is the named account manager?"         # → no entry; answered undomained
```

**Example manifest**

```yaml
version: "1.0"
knowledge_bases:
  - project-docs
prompt: |
  You are a compliance expert. Answer each question concisely and cite the relevant policy section.
questions:
  - id: "security-policy"
    question: "What is the data retention policy?"

  - id: "sla"
    question: "What are the service level objectives?"

  - id: "compliance"
    question: "Which compliance certifications does the product hold?"
```

**Example — run a batch**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag answer batch ~/rfp/questions.yaml

Found 3 questions in batch manifest version 1.0
[1/3] Question: What is the data retention policy?
Answer: Data is retained for 90 days by default, configurable up to 7 years for compliance tiers.
---
[2/3] Question: What are the service level objectives?
Answer: The product targets 99.9% uptime with a 4-hour RTO and 1-hour RPO for business-critical tiers.
---
[3/3] Question: Which compliance certifications does the product hold?
Answer: The product holds SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP Moderate certifications.

### `answer batch --build`

Parse an RFP or RFI document (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, or CSV), guide through format-specific extraction
options, and produce a YAML manifest ready to feed into `answer batch`. This is the recommended way
to turn a vendor questionnaire into an answerable batch job without manually copying questions.

```
rag-cli.rag answer batch --build <document-path> [--output <path>] [--preview]
```

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--build` | | _(required)_ | Document path to extract RFP/RFI questions from |
| `--output` | `-o` | `<document-name>-rfp.yaml` | Output YAML manifest path |
| `--preview` | | `false` | Print extracted questions without writing the manifest |
| `--no-refine` | | `false` | Skip the LLM semantic refinement step and write the manifest with raw extracted questions |

The command detects the file format from the extension and asks format-specific questions before
extracting. After extraction you review every question in an interactive multi-select (all checked
by default) and remove any that do not belong. Remaining questions are renumbered consecutively
before the manifest is written.

---

### Supported formats

#### CSV

The header row is read and shown. Select which column contains the question text — single-column
files skip the prompt automatically. Every subsequent non-empty row in that column becomes a
question.

#### XLSX

Apache Tika converts the workbook to HTML. Each `<table>` element found in the HTML becomes a
selectable entry. You can select multiple tables (e.g. several sheets from the same workbook) in
one pass; each question is tagged with its sheet name in the `source` field.

Interactive prompts:

1. **Table selection** — multi-select over all detected tables. Labels show the sheet name and the
   first three column headers as a preview. When a sheet contains more than one table the labels
   read `Sheet Name — Table 1`, `Sheet Name — Table 2`, and so on.
2. **Column selection** — choose which column holds the question text, based on the first selected
   table's headers.
3. **Force column** — optionally override the column by typing its number (e.g. `3` for column C).
   Useful when header detection is incomplete.
4. **Minimum length** — skip cells shorter than N characters to filter out section headings mixed
   into the question column. Default is 20; enter `0` to include all cells.

#### PDF / DOCX

Apache Tika extracts content as HTML. You first choose how questions are structured in the
document:

**Numbered / bulleted list or question marks**

Page boundaries are detected from Tika's `<div class="page">` elements, so the page count is
accurate even for PDFs where form-feed separators are absent in plain-text mode. Prompts:

1. **Page start** — which page do the questions begin on? Entering a page number skips cover pages
   and table-of-contents sections that would otherwise be captured.
2. **TOC filter** — optionally strip table-of-contents entries. Entries matching the pattern
   `<section-number> <title> <page-number>` (e.g. `2.1 Background 5`) are removed. Applies to
   dotted subsections as well as top-level sections.

**Table — extract from a column**

Tika HTML is scanned for `<table>` elements across the document. Prompts mirror the XLSX flow:
table selection, column selection, column override, and minimum length. Use this mode when the RFP
presents requirements or questions in a structured table rather than a numbered list.

> **Note:** Tika does not always produce HTML `<table>` elements for PDF tables — some PDFs render
> their tables as formatted plain text. If table mode reports "no HTML tables found", switch to
> "Numbered / bulleted list or question marks" mode instead.

---

### Question review

After extraction, all questions are presented in a scrollable multi-select with every item
pre-checked. Press Space to uncheck (remove) entries that should not appear in the manifest, then
Enter to confirm. If you deselect everything the extraction is cancelled and no file is written.
Questions are renumbered `1, 2, 3, …` after any removals so the manifest has consecutive IDs.

---

### Output manifest

The manifest is compatible with `answer batch` (same YAML schema). The `source` field is populated
for XLSX and multi-table PDF extractions so you can trace each answer back to the original sheet or
table.

Above the manifest, a commented-out `domains:` block is written as a starting point for
[domain routing](#domain-routing). It is comment text only — the manifest runs with no routing until
you uncomment and fill it in — and the patterns it suggests are the id prefixes and sources this
particular document produced, not a recommended grouping. A question whose id carries a non-digit
prefix (`C4` → `C*`) suggests that prefix; a question whose id is a bare sequence number has no
prefix to route on, so its `source` is suggested instead.

```yaml
# Generated by rag-cli answer batch --build on 2026-04-29 10:00:00 UTC
#
# Optional domain routing. Uncomment and fill in to answer each group of
# questions within a stated requirement domain; leave it commented out to answer
# every question the same way. An entry needs a context, keywords, or both --
# uncommented but unfilled, the block is rejected rather than ignored. The most
# specific matching pattern wins, and patterns may use * and ?. A question id is
# matched first; an id that is a bare sequence number is matched against its
# source instead. The patterns below are the id prefixes and sources this
# document produced, not a suggested grouping.
#
# domains:
#   - match: "6 Project Background and Scope"   # 1 question(s) by source
#     context: ""   # one sentence naming the requirement domain
#     keywords: []   # optional retrieval terms, a few at most
#   - match: "12 Operational Risk"   # 1 question(s) by source
#     context: ""
#     keywords: []
#
version: "1.0"
knowledge_bases:
  - project-docs
questions:
  - id: "1"
    question: "Describe your approach to patch management."
    source: "6 Project Background and Scope"
  - id: "2"
    question: "What SLA do you offer for critical incidents?"
    source: "12 Operational Risk"
```

> **Tip:** when the extraction assigned bare sequence numbers as ids, uncommenting the suggested
> source patterns is usually all the routing you need — each sheet or document section becomes one
> requirement domain. Give every entry you keep a `context`, and delete the ones you do not want.

## Prompt

The `prompt` command (alias `p`) manages the system prompts used by the RAG pipeline. Customised prompts override the built-in defaults at runtime — no rebuild or reinstall is needed.

### Where prompts are stored

Prompts live in one of two places, depending on whether the `ragd` daemon is running:

| | Stored in | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| **Daemon running** (the usual case) | the daemon, under `$SNAP_COMMON/ragd/prompts/` (one file per variant) | `chat`, `answer batch`, the [web UI](local-ui.md), and the [REST API](rest-api.md) |
| **No daemon** (direct CLI runs) | `~/.config/rag-cli/prompts.json` | direct (daemonless) CLI runs only |

Named **variants** and version history are a daemon-only feature (the daemonless file keeps the
single-override behaviour). A pre-existing daemon `prompts.json` is migrated automatically the
first time the daemon starts after upgrade: each override becomes a `custom` variant, activated.

`prompt init` writes to whichever applies, and `chat` / `answer batch` prefer the daemon whenever
it is running — so with `ragd` active, the **daemon store is the one that matters**. A prompt
saved there is shared with the web UI and applies to every client.

> **Migrating from a CLI-local file:** the daemon runs as a service with its own home directory,
> so it cannot read `~/.config/rag-cli/prompts.json`. If you customised prompts before the daemon
> existed, `prompt init` notices and offers — once, and only with your confirmation — to re-save
> them to the daemon. Nothing is copied silently, and the local file is left in place for
> daemonless runs.

### Sub-commands at a glance

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `prompt init` | Interactively select a prompt, then a variant — edit, create, activate, or restore |
| `prompt list` | List the slots, their active selection, and each slot's variants |
| `prompt save <slot> <name> [--file f]` | Save a variant (new version) from a file or stdin |
| `prompt use <slot> <name>` / `--default` | Activate a variant (or the built-in default) on a slot |
| `prompt history <slot> <name>` | Show a variant's version history |
| `prompt restore <slot> <name> <version>` | Restore an earlier version as a new version |
| `prompt delete <slot> <name>` | Delete a variant |

The two generation slots (`chat_system_prompt`, `answer_system_prompt`) support **named
variants** — keep one prompt per task (answering RFPs, a presales-call assistant, support triage)
and switch between them by activating one. Every save appends to a linear version history, so an
earlier wording can always be restored. The `source_rules` guardrail has a single override only.
The `list`/`save`/`use`/`history`/`restore`/`delete` subcommands require the `ragd` daemon.

**Example — build and activate a variant for a presales call**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag prompt save chat_system_prompt presales-call --file presales.txt
Saved chat_system_prompt/presales-call (now at version 1).
Activate it with: rag-cli.rag prompt use chat_system_prompt presales-call

$ rag-cli.rag prompt use chat_system_prompt presales-call
chat_system_prompt is now using variant "presales-call". New chats and batch runs will use it.
```

Select a variant for a single session without changing the active one with `chat --prompt`:

```bash
rag-cli.rag chat --prompt presales-call
```

For batch runs, name a variant in the manifest with `prompt_ref:` (mutually exclusive with the
inline `prompt:`; requires the daemon). The exported results record which `variant@version`
produced them, as an audit trail:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
prompt_ref: rfp-govco-2026
questions:
  - question: What certifications does the platform hold?
```

---

### `prompt init`

Opens the interactive flow. Select a slot, then — for a generation slot — a variant to edit, a
new variant to create, or the built-in default; you can then edit (save a new version), activate,
or restore an earlier version. The `source_rules` guardrail keeps the simple edit/reset flow.

```
rag-cli.rag prompt init
```

Three prompts are configurable:

| Prompt key | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `answer_system_prompt` | `answer batch` | System instruction for batch Q&A mode. Controls tone, format, and grounding behaviour for RFP/RFI answers. |
| `chat_system_prompt` | `chat` | System instruction for the interactive REPL. Controls how the assistant responds during a live session. |
| `source_rules` | `answer batch` | Grounding constraints appended to any custom `prompt:` field in a batch manifest. Prevents custom prompts from bypassing `[CANONICAL]`/`[UPSTREAM]` source prioritisation rules. |

> Context chunks are tagged with the **knowledge labels** assigned at ingest (see `knowledge
> label`). The built-in prompts define priority for the default label set (`[CANONICAL]`,
> `[KAPA-CANONICAL]`, `[UPSTREAM]`); if you ingest with custom labels, save a prompt variant that
> tells the model how to treat those tags.

**Example**

```bash
$ rag-cli.rag prompt init

  Which prompt do you want to configure?
  > chat_system_prompt   — system instruction for the interactive chat REPL (chat)
    answer_system_prompt — system instruction for batch Q&A mode (answer batch)
    source_rules         — grounding constraints appended to custom batch prompts (answer batch)

  Edit: answer_system_prompt
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ You are a Canonical support engineer responding to a procurement executive…  │
  │                                                                              │
  │ (edit the text above, then press Alt+Enter or Ctrl+J to save)               │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

answer_system_prompt saved to the daemon. New chats and batch runs will use it.
```

A prompt that is already customised is marked `[customized]` in the list, and selecting it offers
to edit it or reset it to the built-in default.

> **When a saved prompt takes effect:** the daemon resolves prompts when a chat session or batch
> run *starts*. Saving a prompt applies to the next session or run — work already in flight keeps
> the prompts it began with.

> **Note on source rules:** When a batch manifest includes a top-level `prompt:` field, the
> `source_rules` prompt is automatically appended to it. This ensures that even fully custom
> prompts respect the `[CANONICAL]`/`[UPSTREAM]` prioritisation logic. Edit `source_rules` only
> if you need to adjust the grounding constraints themselves, not just the tone or format.

> **Note on defaults:** Only your customisations are stored — a prompt you never edited always
> tracks the built-in default of the installed release. Reset a prompt from `prompt init` (or from
> the web UI's Prompts page); daemonless setups can also delete `~/.config/rag-cli/prompts.json`
> to restore every default at once.

---

## REST API (`ragd`)

`rag-cli` ships an optional daemon, `ragd`, that exposes the knowledge, search, chat, and
batch-answering capabilities over a versioned REST API on a local unix socket — so any local
program (including the `rag` CLI itself) can drive the RAG stack without rebuilding clients
or handling credentials.

See **[REST API guide](rest-api.md)** for service management, socket configuration and the
security model, the response envelope, async operations and events, and the full endpoint
reference. The authoritative contract is the generated
[`rest-api.yaml`](../rest-api.yaml) OpenAPI specification.
